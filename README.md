Option is a full-stack streaming website that brings together Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons, and Anime — all in one place, with a clean interface and minimal distractions. Think of it like a TMDB-powered frontend with Vidlink player integration.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

I wanted to watch anime, cartoons, and movies from one place — and I couldn’t find a good UI-based experience that didn’t require switching apps or sites. So I built one.

This project also holds a personal meaning — I built it as a tribute to someone I deeply admire, **Sireesha**. Her presence and inspiration pushed me to follow through with this idea and give it my all.

Through this journey, I learned:
- How to use APIs effectively (TMDB)
- Embed streaming players using iframes
- Bypass regional restrictions using Cloudflare Workers
- Build clean, responsive UIs with reusable components
- it's hard to impress Angels

## 🧠 What I Want to Do Next

- Add watchlists / favorites
- Add user authentication (maybe Supabase/Auth.js)
- Improve search with filters
- Get real feedback from users or contributors
