## 🤔 Why I Built This

I wanted to watch anime, cartoons, and movies from one place — and I couldn’t find a good UI-based experience that didn’t require switching apps or sites. So I built one.

It started as a curiosity project and helped me learn:
- How to use APIs effectively (TMDB)
- Embed streaming securely
- Bypass regional restrictions
- Build clean UI/UX with reusable components

---

## 🧠 What I Want to Do Next

- Add watchlists / favorites
- Add user authentication (maybe Supabase/Auth.js)
- Improve search with filters
- Get real feedback from users or contributors
